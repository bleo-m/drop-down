## Introduction

Here is my completed drop down menu component. I created a simple page demonstrating it in action, where there is one drop down menu next to another one. The difference between them is that one allows for multiple selection.

## How to run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Component Behavior

- To select an option, simply click on the name of the option.
- To exit the drop down menu and submit the option(s), click anywhere outside of the drop down menu.
- In the multi-select menu (the menu on the right), you can select multiple options. You can also de-select any option by clicking on it again.
- Options that have already been selected will have a light blue background and will show up at the top of the menu.
