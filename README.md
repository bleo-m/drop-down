# Leo Martinez - Hive Frontend Challenge Submission

## Introduction

Here is my completed drop down menu component. I created a simple page demonstrating it in action, where there is one drop down menu next to another one. The difference between them is that one allows for multiple selection.

## How to run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
